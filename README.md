# Rigid Pavement BUC Stress

This repository contains python code and output plots of Bottom-Up cracking stresses in rigid pavement as per [Pavement Design Guidelines (Rigid Pavement) 2021, DoR](https://dor.gov.np/qrdc/publication/rsdp-procurement-plan/force/rigid-pavement-guideline-2-21).

- The plots generated here differ from those given in the guidelines. *Check plots for the condition: Single axle with concrete shoulders ΔT = 0°C.*
- The relevant stress formulae in this guideline are found to be borrowed from [Guidelines  for the design of Plain Jointed riGid Pavements for highways 2015, *IRC 58:2015*](https://archive.org/details/gov.in.irc.058.2015); nevertheless, the plots generated here do not match with that of the IRC guidelines either.

Feedback is welcome.
